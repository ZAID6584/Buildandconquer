# AI Traffic Management System Website

This project showcases a modern, responsive website for an AI-driven traffic management system with real-time traffic visualization and AI route optimization for Bangalore, India. It features interactive maps, theme switching, real-time location detection, and intelligent traffic rerouting.

## Features

- **Interactive Maps**: Real-time traffic visualization and route optimization using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap
- **Multiple Themes**: Choose between Default, Cyberpunk, and Retro themes with dynamic styling
- **Location Services**:
  - Current location detection
  - Location search with Nominatim API
  - Interactive route planning
- **AI Route Optimization**: Intelligent rerouting around traffic congestion
- **Bangalore-Specific Routes**: Focused on real Bangalore traffic patterns and hotspots
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices from mobile to desktop
- **Clean Modern UI**: Beautiful interface with animations and intuitive navigation

## Project Structure

```
- index.html (main page)
- css/
  - styles.css (main stylesheet)

```

## Running the Website

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No server or build step is required as this is a static website.

## Interactive Demo

The website includes an interactive demo that simulates traffic flow at an intersection. You can:

- Adjust traffic density using the slider
- Switch between different AI algorithms (Fixed Timing, Adaptive AI, Predictive AI)
- Start/pause the simulation to see the AI in action
- View real-time statistics on waiting times and efficiency gains

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with flexbox and grid for layouts)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas (for traffic simulation)

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for this project could include:

- Backend integration for real traffic data
