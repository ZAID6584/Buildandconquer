# AI Traffic Management System Website

This project showcases a modern, responsive website for an AI-driven traffic management system. It features interactive demonstrations, detailed explanations of the system's features, and a roadmap for development.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices from mobile to desktop
- **Interactive Traffic Simulation**: Canvas-based demo showing AI traffic management in action
- **Clean Modern UI**: Beautiful interface with animations and intuitive navigation
- **Complete Information Architecture**: From problem statement to implementation roadmap

## Project Structure

```
- index.html (main page)
- css/
  - styles.css (main stylesheet)
- js/
  - main.js (navigation and UI functionality)
  - simulation.js (traffic simulation visualization)
- images/ (website images)
- README.md (this file)
```

## Running the Website

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No server or build step is required as this is a static website.

## Interactive Demo

The website includes an interactive demo that simulates traffic flow at an intersection. You can:

- Adjust traffic density using the slider
- Switch between different AI algorithms (Fixed Timing, Adaptive AI, Predictive AI)
- Start/pause the simulation to see the AI in action
- View real-time statistics on waiting times and efficiency gains

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with flexbox and grid for layouts)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas (for traffic simulation)

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for this project could include:

- Backend integration for real traffic data
- More sophisticated AI simulation models
- User accounts for traffic management professionals
- Mobile app integration
- Real-time monitoring dashboards

## Credits

Created as a demonstration of an AI Traffic Management System website.
